## 5. Results

The experimental data collected from the repulsion and attraction tests are presented below.

### 5.1 Experiment 1: Balloon Repulsion
Table I presents the data regarding the repulsion between two charged balloons. In both trials, the balloons were charged for a constant duration of 25 seconds.

**Table I: Observations of Balloon Repulsion**

| Test Number | Charging Time (s) | Initial Separation (cm) | Final Separation (cm) | Change in Distance (cm) | Duration of Repulsion (min:s) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 25 | 5 | 8 | +3 | 12:45 |
| 2 | 25 | 5 | 8 | +3 | 13:20 |

As observed in Table I, the balloons exhibited a consistent repulsive force in both trials. The separation distance increased by 3 cm in both cases (from 5 cm to 8 cm). The electrostatic charge was retained for a significant period, with the repulsion effect lasting between 12 minutes 45 seconds and 13 minutes 20 seconds.

### 5.2 Experiment 2: Drink Can Attraction
Table II displays the distance traveled by a neutral drink can when attracted by a charged balloon.

> [!NOTE] Data Unit
> The distance traveled is recorded in **meters (m)** as per the experimental measurements.

**Table II: Distance Traveled by the Drink Can**

| Test Number | Charging Time (s) | Distance Traveled (m) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 25 | 29.4 |
| 2 | 25 | 23.8 |

Table II indicates that the charged balloon was able to induce movement in the drink can. In the first test, the can traveled a total distance of 29.4 m, whereas in the second test, it traveled 23.8 m.
