## Abstract 
(About 100 words, 10 points)

This experiment investigates the photoelectric effect to verify Einstein's equation and determine Planck's constant ($h$) and the work function ($w$) of the photocathode. We measured the stopping potentials ($\Delta V_s$) for five different wavelengths of light from a mercury lamp. The frequency ($\nu$) of each light was calculated, and a linear relationship between $\Delta V_s$ and $\nu$ was plotted. Using the least-squares fitting method, the slope of the line ($k = h/e$) and the y-intercept ($b = -w/e$) were determined. From these values, Planck's constant was calculated to be $h = 6.719 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}$, with an excellent relative error of $1.4\%$. The work function of the metal was found to be $w = 1.44 \text{ eV}$.

### 2. Calculations

**(1) Compute the frequencies ($\nu$)**
* We use the formula $\nu = c / \lambda$, where $c = 3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}$。
* **Sample Calculation (for $\lambda = 365 \text{ nm}$):**
    * $\lambda = 365 \text{ nm} = 365 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}$
    * $\nu = (3.00 \times 10^8 \text{ m/s}) / (365 \times 10^{-9} \text{ m}) = 8.219... \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz} \approx 8.22 \times 10^{14} \text{ Hz}$
* (Other frequencies are calculated similarly and listed in Data Table 7-1.)

**(2) Determine Planck's Constant ($h$) and Work Function ($w$)**
* 我们使用爱因斯坦方程 $\Delta V_s = (h/e)\nu - (w/e)$，它符合 $\Delta V_s = k\nu + b$ 的线性关系。
* 在此计算中，我们使用遏止电压的**大小**（绝对值），即 $V_s = |\Delta V_s|$。
* **用于最小二乘法拟合 (Least-Squares Fitting) 的数据点 (N=5):**
    * $x$ (Frequency, $\nu$ / $10^{14}$ Hz): [8.22, 7.41, 6.88, 5.49, 5.20]
    * $y$ (Stopping Potential, $V_s$ / V): [2.015, 1.650, 1.460, 0.865, 0.740]

* **拟合结果 (Fit Results):**
    * **Slope (k):** $k = 0.4194 \times 10^{-14} \text{ V}\cdot\text{s}$
    * **Y-intercept (b):** $b = -1.438 \text{ V}$

* **普朗克常数 ($h$) 的计算:**
    * $k = h/e \implies h = k \times e$
    * $h = (0.4194 \times 10^{-14} \text{ V}\cdot\text{s}) \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C})$
    * $h = 6.719 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}$

* **相对误差 (Relative Error for $h$):**
    * $E = \frac{|h_{\text{measured}} - h_{\text{accepted}}|}{h_{\text{accepted}}} \times 100\%$
    * $E = \frac{|6.719 \times 10^{-34} - 6.626 \times 10^{-34}|}{6.626 \times 10^{-34}} \times 100\% = \mathbf{1.4\%}$

* **功函数 ($w$) 的计算:**
    * $b = -w/e \implies w = -b \times e$
    * $w = -(-1.438 \text{ V}) \times (1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}) = 2.304 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}$
    * **功函数 (eV):**
        * $w \text{ (eV)} = \frac{w \text{ (J)}}{e} = \frac{2.304 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ J/eV}} = 1.44 \text{ eV}$
        * (Or simply, $w \text{ (eV)} = -b = -(-1.438 \text{ V}) = 1.44 \text{ eV}$)

### 3. Graphing

*(1) A graph of Stopping Potential $V_s$ (V) vs. Frequency $\nu$ ($10^{14}$ Hz) should be plotted using the data from Table 7-1. This graph will show the 5 data points and the linear least-squares fit line, $V_s = (0.4194 \times 10^{-14})\nu - 1.438$.*

*(2) A graph of Photoelectric Current $I$ ($10^{-11}$ A) vs. Applied Voltage $\Delta V$ (V) should be plotted using the data from Table 7-2. This graph will show two curves, one for $d=30\text{cm}$ and one for $d=40\text{cm}$, demonstrating the effect of light intensity on the saturation current.*

## Conclusions 
(About 100 words, 5 points)

In this experiment, we successfully verified Einstein's photoelectric equation by observing the linear relationship between stopping potential and the frequency of incident light. From the slope of the $V_s$ vs. $\nu$ graph, Planck's constant was determined to be $h = 6.719 \times 10^{-34} \text{ J}\cdot\text{s}$. This value shows excellent agreement with the accepted value, with a small relative error of $1.4\%$. This indicates a high degree of precision in the measurement. From the y-intercept of the graph, the work function of the photocathode material was calculated to be $w = 1.44 \text{ eV}$. The experiment successfully confirms the particle nature of light.

## Answers to Postlab Questions 
(10 points)

**(1) For a given light intensity, when the accelerating voltage increases, the photoelectric current increases and then reaches the saturation. Why?**
**Answer:**
* **Increase Phase:** When a positive (accelerating) voltage is applied, it helps the collector (anode) attract the photoelectrons emitted from the emitter (cathode). As the voltage increases, more of the emitted electrons are successfully collected, and the current rises.
* **Saturation Phase:** The number of photoelectrons emitted per second is determined *only* by the light intensity (number of photons arriving per second). Once the accelerating voltage is high enough to collect *all* the electrons that are being emitted, the current reaches its maximum (saturation) value. Even if the voltage increases further, the current cannot increase, because no more electrons are available to be collected.

**(2) State what property of light is demonstrated by the photoelectric effect.**
**Answer:**
The photoelectric effect demonstrates the **particle nature of light** (or its wave-particle duality). It shows that light energy is not continuous (as a wave would be) but is delivered in discrete packets, or "quanta," called **photons**. This model is necessary to explain the existence of a threshold frequency and why the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends on frequency, not intensity.

**(3) How would you claim that the Einstein's equation is verified by the photoelectric effect experiment?**
**Answer:**
Einstein's equation predicts a specific **linear relationship** between the stopping potential ($\Delta V_s$) and the frequency of light ($\nu$): $\Delta V_s = (h/e)\nu - (w/e)$.
* Our experiment verifies this equation by taking measurements at five different frequencies.
* When we plotted our measured stopping potentials ($y$-axis) against their corresponding frequencies ($x$-axis), the data points clearly formed a straight line, as predicted.
* The fact that the data fits a linear model (with a high correlation coefficient) confirms the validity of Einstein's equation. Furthermore, the slope ($k=h/e$) and intercept ($b=-w/e$) of this line allowed us to experimentally determine the values of Planck's constant $h$ and the work function $w$.
