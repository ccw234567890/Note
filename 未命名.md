## 1. Abstract
*(Approx. 100 words)*

This experiment aims to measure the Young's Modulus of a steel wire using the elongation method. The small elongation of the wire under tensile stress was magnified and measured using an optical lever and a telescope-scale system. Key parameters were measured: the wire's original length $L = 644.0 \text{ mm}$, diameter $d = 0.578 \text{ mm}$, and the optical lever parameters whose $D = 1532.0 \text{ mm}, b = 68.88 \text{ mm}$. By applying loads from 2.00 kg to 10.00 kg, the elongation $\Delta n$ corresponding to a 4 kg mass increment was found to be approximately 21.3 mm. Based on the stress-strain data calculated, the Young's Modulus of the steel wire was determined to be approximately **$2.05 \times 10^{11} \text{ Pa}$**. The results verify Hooke's Law within the elastic limit.

## 2. Conclusion
*(Summarize results and error analysis)*

Through this experiment, we successfully determined the Young's modulus of the steel material.
1.  **Results:** The linear relationship between Stress ($\sigma$) and Strain ($\varepsilon$) plotted from the experimental data confirms that the wire behaves elastically under the applied loads. The final calculated Young's Modulus is consistent with the theoretical value for steel (approx. $2.0 \times 10^{11} \text{ Pa}$).
2.  **Error Analysis:**
    * **Systematic Error:** The measurement of the wire diameter $d$ has the most significant impact on the uncertainty (squared term).
    * **Random Error:** Readings from the telescope scale may fluctuate due to parallax or visual estimation errors.
    * **Instrumental Error:** The unevenness of the wire or slight slipping of the optical lever feet could introduce deviations.
3.  **Method:** The optical lever proved to be an effective tool for magnifying microscopic length changes ($\Delta L$) into measurable scale shifts ($\Delta n$).

## 3. Answers to Questions
*(Based on Fig. 1 and experimental theory)*

### 3.1 Micrometer Reading & Error (4 points)
* **Reading:**
    * On the **fixed sleeve (main scale)**, the 0 mm mark is visible, and the **0.5 mm** half-mark below the line is clearly exposed.
    * On the **thimble (rotating scale)**, the horizontal line aligns with the **42nd** division (above 40). This represents $0.420 \text{ mm}$.
    * **Total Reading** = $0.5 \text{ mm} + 0.420 \text{ mm} = \mathbf{0.920 \text{ mm}}$.
* **Instrument Error:**
    * The standard instrument error limit ($\Delta_{inst}$) for a laboratory micrometer gauge is typically **0.004 mm** (or 0.005 mm, depending on specific lab standards).

### 3.2 Proper Placement of Optical Lever (6 points)
To ensure accurate measurement of $\Delta L$, the optical lever must be placed as follows:
1.  **Front Feet:** The two front feet (knife-edges) must be placed firmly inside the **transverse groove** on the fixed platform (the chuck stand).
2.  **Rear Foot:** The single rear foot (pointed tip) must rest on the upper surface of the **moving cylindrical clamp** (which holds the wire).
3.  **No Contact:** The main body of the optical lever must **not touch** the steel wire or the sides of the hole in the platform. It should be free to tilt as the wire elongates.
4.  **Stability:** Ensure the mirror is roughly vertical so the reflected image of the meter stick can be directed toward the telescope.

### 3.3 Reasons for Not Observing the Meter Stick (10 points)
If the meter stick's image cannot be seen in the telescope, the possible reasons include:
1.  **Horizontal Misalignment:** The telescope is not pointing directly at the center of the plane mirror. The "gun sight" (aiming aid) on top of the telescope should be used for rough alignment first.
2.  **Vertical Height Mismatch:** The telescope is adjusted too high or too low relative to the height of the optical lever, causing the line of sight to miss the mirror.
3.  **Improper Mirror Angle:** The inclination of the plane mirror is too extreme (pointing at the ceiling or floor). This can be adjusted using the screw behind the mirror or by checking the foot placement.
4.  **Focus Issues:** The telescope is not focused. The eyepiece should be focused on the crosshairs, and the objective lens knob should be adjusted to focus on the *reflected image* of the ruler (distant object), not the mirror surface itself.
5.  **Obstruction:** There may be physical obstacles blocking the light path between the meter stick, the mirror, and the telescope.
