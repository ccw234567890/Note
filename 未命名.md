## 1. Abstract
*(About 100 words)*

This experiment aims to apply the **null balance measuring method** (compensation method) to determine the electromotive force (EMF) of a thermocouple using a potentiometer. The primary objective is to understand the working principle of the potentiometer and to verify the relationship between temperature and thermal EMF.

In the experiment, we first calibrated the galvanometer using a standard cell to ensure zero deflection. We then measured the thermal EMF generated by the thermocouple at temperatures ranging from **35°C to 85°C**. The results were analyzed by plotting a graph of Temperature ($T$) versus Thermal EMF ($E$). The analysis reveals a strict linear relationship, with the fitted equation determined as **$E = 0.0376 T - 0.5636 \text{ (mV)}$**. The experiment successfully confirms the linear characteristic of the thermocouple and demonstrates the high precision of the null balance method in measuring small EMFs.

**Figure 1:** The linear relationship between Temperature ($T$) and Thermal EMF ($E$). As shown in the graph, the data points align linearly.

### III. Calculation of Slope and Intercept
Based on the data points from Table 1, we select the first point $A(35, 0.7524)$ and the last point $B(85, 2.6325)$ to calculate the slope ($k$) and intercept ($b$) of the fitted line.

**1. Calculation of Slope ($k$):**
$$
k = \frac{E_2 - E_1}{T_2 - T_1} = \frac{2.6325 - 0.7524}{85 - 35} \text{ mV}/^\circ\text{C}
$$
$$
k = \frac{1.8801}{50} = 0.0376 \text{ mV}/^\circ\text{C}
$$

**2. Calculation of Intercept ($b$):**
Using the point $(35, 0.7524)$ and the calculated slope $k = 0.0376$:
$$
b = E - k \times T = 0.7524 - (0.0376 \times 35)
$$
$$
b = 0.7524 - 1.316 = -0.5636 \text{ mV}
$$

**3. Final Fitted Equation:**
Thus, the empirical formula describing the relationship is:
$$
\boxed{E = 0.0376 T - 0.5636 \text{ (mV)}}
$$

## 3. Conclusions
*(About 100 words)*

Based on the experimental data and the analysis performed above, we can draw the following conclusions:

1.  **Linear Relationship:** The thermal electromotive force ($E$) is directly proportional to the temperature difference ($T$). The experimental data fits the linear equation $E = 0.0376 T - 0.5636$ with a high degree of accuracy.
2.  **Method Validity:** The **null balance method** proved to be an effective way to measure the open-circuit voltage (EMF) without drawing current from the thermocouple. This avoids errors caused by the internal resistance of the source, which is a significant advantage over using a standard voltmeter or ammeter.
3.  **Error Analysis:** Minor deviations in the data (as seen in the scatter plot) may be attributed to fluctuations in the water bath temperature during the reading process or visual parallax errors when reading the galvanometer scale. However, the overall trend is consistent with theoretical expectations.

## 4. Answers to Postlab Questions

### Q1: Why does the galvanometer pointer oscillate or fail to stay at zero during measurement?
**Answer:**
The oscillation or instability of the galvanometer pointer can be attributed to several factors:
1.  **High Sensitivity:** The galvanometer is extremely sensitive to weak currents. Any electromagnetic interference from the environment (e.g., nearby mobile phones or power lines) can induce small currents, causing the pointer to jitter.
2.  **Unstable Contact:** Poor contact in the sliding wire or switches can cause resistance fluctuations, leading to unstable current flow.
3.  **Temperature Fluctuation:** If the temperature of the thermocouple is not stable (e.g., the water is still heating up rapidly), the EMF will change continuously, making it difficult to find a stable null point.

### Q2: Can we replace the galvanometer with an ammeter in this experiment? Why?
**Answer:**
**No, we cannot.**
The fundamental principle of this experiment is the **Null Balance Method** (Compensation Method).
* **Zero Current Requirement:** This method measures the true EMF only when there is **zero current** flowing through the measured circuit loop.
* **Internal Resistance:** An ammeter (or a standard voltmeter) draws current to operate. If used, the current flowing through the thermocouple's internal resistance would cause a voltage drop ($V_{drop} = I \times r$), meaning the measured voltage would be lower than the actual EMF ($V_{measured} = E - Ir$).
* **Accuracy:** Therefore, a galvanometer is essential because it serves as a null detector to confirm the "no current" state, ensuring the measurement result is the true electromotive force.
