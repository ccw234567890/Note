# Lab Report: Results and Discussion Draft

## 5. Results

The experimental data collected from the repulsion and attraction tests are presented below.

### 5.1 Experiment 1: Balloon Repulsion
Table I presents the data regarding the repulsion between two charged balloons. In both trials, the balloons were charged for a constant duration of 25 seconds.

**Table I: Observations of Balloon Repulsion**

| Test Number | Charging Time (s) | Initial Separation (cm) | Final Separation (cm) | Change in Distance (cm) | Duration of Repulsion (min:s) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 25 | 5 | 8 | +3 | 13:50 |
| 2 | 25 | 5 | 8 | +3 | 13:00 |

As observed in Table I, the balloons exhibited a consistent repulsive force in both trials. The separation distance increased by 3 cm in both cases (from 5 cm to 8 cm). The electrostatic charge was retained for a significant period, with the repulsion effect lasting between 13 minutes and 13 minutes 50 seconds.

### 5.2 Experiment 2: Drink Can Attraction
Table II displays the distance traveled by a neutral drink can when attracted by a charged balloon.

**Table II: Distance Traveled by the Drink Can**

| Test Number | Charging Time (s) | Distance Traveled (m) |
| :---: | :---: | :---: |
| 1 | 25 | 54.6 |
| 2 | 25 | 29.4 |

Table II indicates that the charged balloon was able to induce movement in the drink can. However, a significant variance was observed between the two trials. In the first test, the can traveled a total distance of 54.6 m, whereas in the second test, it traveled 29.4 m.

## 6. Discussion

### 6.1 Analysis of Repulsion (Experiment 1)
The results from the first experiment successfully demonstrated the principle of electrostatic repulsion. As shown in Table I, the two balloons moved apart by 3 cm after being rubbed against the wool material. According to **Ashby [1]**, rubbing materials together causes electrons to transfer from one surface to another, resulting in both objects acquiring an electrostatic charge. Since the balloons were rubbed against the same material for the same amount of time, they acquired the same type of charge. The observed separation confirms the fundamental law of electrostatics that "like charges repel" [1, 2].

The duration of the repulsion was notably long, lasting over 13 minutes in both trials. **Beckett [5]** notes that while some materials dissipate charge quickly, others can hold charges for extended periods. The extended duration suggests that the latex material of the balloons is an effective insulator and that the environmental conditions, such as humidity, may have been low enough to prevent rapid charge dissipation [4].

### 6.2 Analysis of Attraction (Experiment 2)
The second experiment demonstrated that a charged object (the balloon) can exert an attractive force on a neutral object (the drink can). This aligns with the theory that charged objects can attract neutral conductors or insulators depending on the substance [2]. The electrostatic field of the balloon likely induced an opposite charge on the side of the can facing it, causing the can to roll towards the balloon.

**Analysis of Data Discrepancy**
A substantial discrepancy was observed in the distance traveled by the can between the two trials (54.6 m vs 29.4 m), despite the charging time remaining constant at 25 seconds. Several factors could explain this variation:

1.  **Operational Consistency:** The instruction required the operator to move the can "as far as possible" by keeping the balloon close without touching. Maintaining a consistent optimal distance between the moving balloon and the rolling can is challenging. In the second trial, the operator may have inadvertently held the balloon too far from the can, weakening the attractive force, or too close, risking a partial discharge.
2.  **Surface Friction:** The experiment relies on the can rolling on a flat surface. Even minor irregularities or dust on the floor/table could significantly increase friction in certain areas, impeding the can's movement in the second trial compared to the first.
3.  **Charge Dissipation:** As noted by **Welker et al. [4]**, electrostatic charge dissipates over time, particularly if there is moisture in the air. It is possible that the balloon in the second trial lost its charge more rapidly due to environmental fluctuations or accidental contact with the operator's hand during the setup.

### 6.3 Limitations
While the experiments confirmed the basic principles of attraction and repulsion, the lack of precise control over the distance between the balloon and the can introduced human error, as evidenced by the variable results in Experiment 2. Future investigations could improve reliability by using a mechanical track to guide the can and a fixed arm to maintain a constant distance between the charged object and the test subject. Additionally, measuring and recording the relative humidity of the room would provide better insight into the charge retention times [3, 4].
