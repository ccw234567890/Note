# Lab Title:
The Millican Oil Drop Experiment

---

## Abstract 
(About 100 words, 10 points)

This experiment was conducted to measure the elementary electric charge, $e$, using the Millikan oil drop method. The experiment involved suspending charged oil droplets in a uniform electric field by balancing the electric force against the gravitational force (the "balance method"). The mass of each droplet was determined by measuring its terminal velocity (fall time) with the electric field turned off. By calculating the total charge $q$ on each droplet, it was shown that the charge is quantized. One droplet's data was discarded as it fell outside the reliable measurement range. Based on 9 valid measurements, the average elementary charge was determined to be $\overline{e} = 1.562 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$. This result has a relative error of $-2.5\%$ compared to the accepted value of $1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$.

### 2. Calculations

**(1) Sample Calculation (Droplet 1)**
* **Given:** $\overline{V_1} = 211 \text{ V}$, $\overline{t_1} = 12.10 \text{ s}$
* **Formula for $q$:** $\overline{q} = \frac{1.43\times10^{-14}}{[\overline{t}(1+0.02\sqrt{\overline{t}})]^{\frac{3}{2}}} \cdot \frac{1}{\overline{V}}$
* **Denominator Term:** $D = [\overline{t_1}(1+0.02\sqrt{\overline{t_1}})]^{\frac{3}{2}} = [12.10(1+0.02\sqrt{12.10})]^{\frac{3}{2}} = [12.10(1.0696)]^{\frac{3}{2}} = (12.945)^{1.5} \approx 46.51$
* **Calculate $q_1$:** $\overline{q_1} = \frac{1.43\times10^{-14}}{46.51} \cdot \frac{1}{211} = (3.075 \times 10^{-16}) \cdot (0.004739) \approx 1.457 \times 10^{-18} \text{ C}$

* **Formula for $n$:** $n = [\frac{\overline{q}}{e}]$, where $e = 1.602\times10^{-19} \text{ C}$ and "[]" means rounding to the nearest integer.
* **Calculate $n_1$:** $n_1 = [\frac{1.457 \times 10^{-18}}{1.602 \times 10^{-19}}] = [9.09] = 9$

* **Formula for $e_i$:** $e = \frac{\overline{q}}{n}$
* **Calculate $e_1$:** $e_1 = \frac{1.457 \times 10^{-18}}{9} \approx 1.619 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$

**(2) Calculated Charges and Elementary Charge (Data Table 3.11-2)**

| Oil droplets | Charges $\overline{q} / \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$ | Number of excess electrons, $n$ | Elementary charge $e / \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$ |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 1 | 14.57 | 9 | 1.619 |
| 2 | 13.72 | 9 | 1.524 |
| 3 | 50.20 | 31 | 1.619 |
| 4 | 5.69 | 4 | 1.424 |
| 5 | 67.27 | 42 | 1.602 |
| 6 | 30.33 | 19 | 1.596 |
| 7 | 12.50 | 8 | 1.562 |
| 8 | 15.75 | 10 | 1.575 |
| 9 | 0.323 | (0) | (Invalid, $\overline{t} < 10\text{s}$) |
| 10 | 16.87 | 11 | 1.534 |
| | | **Average $\overline{e}$ (N=9)** | **$1.562$** |

**(3) Averaged Elementary Charge ($\overline{e}$)**
* Droplet 9 is discarded as $\overline{t} = 2.86 \text{ s}$ is outside the 10-50s recommended range.
* $\overline{e} = \frac{1}{9}\sum_{i=1, i\neq9}^{10} e_{i}$
* $\overline{e} = \frac{1}{9}(1.619 + 1.524 + 1.619 + 1.424 + 1.602 + 1.596 + 1.562 + 1.575 + 1.534) \times 10^{-19}$
* $\overline{e} = \frac{1}{9}(14.055) \times 10^{-19} = 1.5617 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C} \approx 1.562 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$

**(4) Relative Error ($E$)**
* $E = \frac{\overline{e}-e}{e}\times100\%$ (using $e = 1.602\times10^{-19} \text{ C}$)
* $E = \frac{1.562 - 1.602}{1.602} \times 100\% = -2.5\%$

## Conclusions 
(About 100 words, 5 points)

This experiment successfully demonstrated the quantization of electric charge and provided a measurement for the elementary charge, $e$. By analyzing 10 oil droplets (one of which was discarded as an outlier), the total charge $q$ on each was calculated. The charges were found to be integer multiples ($n$) of a fundamental charge. The average value of this elementary charge, based on 9 valid data points, was calculated to be $\overline{e} = 1.562 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$. This result is in reasonable agreement with the accepted value of $1.602 \times 10^{-19} \text{ C}$, yielding a relative error of $-2.5\%$. Potential sources of error include parallax in timing the droplet's fall, the influence of Brownian motion on very small droplets, and slight drifts of the droplet during balancing.

## Answers to Postlab Questions 
(10 points)

### 1. You can observe that some oil droplets go down very fast after introducing the droplets into the chamber. Why?
**Answer:** The terminal velocity ($v$) of a falling droplet is proportional to the square of its radius ($v \propto r^2$), derived from balancing gravity ($F_g \propto r^3$) and Stokes' viscous drag ($F_v \propto r$). Droplets that fall very fast are therefore very large (large $r$) and heavy. Their large mass also means they would require an impractically high voltage to balance, making them unsuitable for this experiment.

### 2. Some oil droplets go down very slowly after removing the potential difference applied on the two parallel plates. Are these droplets good for measurement? Why?
**Answer:** No, these droplets are not good for measurement. A very slow fall time (e.g., $t > 50 \text{ s}$) indicates the droplet is extremely small ($v \propto r^2$). These small droplets are highly susceptible to **Brownian motion**, which is the random buffeting by air molecules. This makes it very difficult to keep the droplet stationary or measure a consistent fall time, leading to large measurement errors. Furthermore, for extremely small droplets, Stokes' Law itself requires a correction factor.

### 3. Give some examples to show the importance of the accurate value of elementary charge.
**Answer:** The elementary charge $e$ is one of the fundamental constants of physics, and its accurate value is critical.
* **Basis of Electromagnetism:** It defines the smallest unit of charge, forming the basis for all electric and magnetic interactions.
* **Fundamental Constants:** It is a key component in other fundamental constants, such as the **Faraday constant** ($F = e \times N_A$, linking electricity to chemistry) and the **fine-structure constant** ($\alpha$), which governs the strength of electromagnetic interactions.
* **Modern Physics:** Its value is essential for calculations in quantum electrodynamics (QED), atomic physics, and particle physics.
