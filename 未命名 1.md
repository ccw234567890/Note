## 1. Abstract
*(Updated to match the Linear Fit Graph)*

This experiment aims to measure the Young's Modulus of a steel wire using the method of elongation. The microscopic elongation of the wire under tensile stress was magnified and measured using an optical lever combined with a telescope and scale system. The geometric parameters of the system were measured: the original length of the wire $L = 644.0 \text{ mm}$, the diameter $d = 0.578 \text{ mm}$, the mirror-to-scale distance $D = 1532.0 \text{ mm}$, and the optical lever arm $b = 68.88 \text{ mm}$. By plotting the Stress vs. Strain curve based on the experimental data , the Young's Modulus was determined from the slope of the linear fit to be approximately **$2.03 \times 10^{11} \text{ Pa}$**. The results demonstrate a strong linear relationship, verifying Hooke's Law within the elastic limit of the material.

## 2. Conclusion
*(Summary of findings and analysis)*

In this experiment, we successfully determined the elastic modulus of the steel specimen.
1.  **Experimental Finding:** The Young's Modulus was calculated to be **$2.03 \times 10^{11} \text{ Pa}$** through linear regression of the Stress-Strain data. This value is in excellent agreement with the standard theoretical value for steel (approx. $2.0 \times 10^{11} \text{ Pa}$).
2.  **Linearity:** The data points on the graph closely follow the fitted line, confirming that the deformation was purely elastic and proportional to the applied force.
3.  **Error Analysis:**
    * **Major Source:** The measurement of the wire's diameter ($d$) contributes significantly to the uncertainty because it appears as a squared term ($d^2$) in the formula.
    * **Systematic/Random Errors:** Minor deviations could arise from the estimation of the tenth of a millimeter on the telescope scale or slight non-verticality of the mirror.

## 3. Answers to Post-lab Questions
*(Based on Fig. 1 and Experimental Theory)*

### Q3.1 Reading & Instrument Error
**Question:** What is the reading shown in Fig. 1? What is the instrument error of the micrometer gauge?
**Answer:**
* **Reading Analysis:**
    * **Main Scale (Sleeve):** The 0 mm mark is visible, and the **0.5 mm** subdivision mark below the datum line is clearly exposed.
    * **Rotating Scale (Thimble):** The horizontal datum line aligns with the **42nd** division on the thimble (two ticks above 40). This adds $0.420 \text{ mm}$.
    * **Total Reading:** $0.5 \text{ mm} + 0.420 \text{ mm} = \mathbf{0.920 \text{ mm}}$.
* **Instrument Error:**
    * The standard instrument error limit ($\Delta_{inst}$) for a laboratory micrometer gauge is typically **0.005 mm** (or 0.004 mm).

### Q3.2 Placement of Optical Lever
**Question:** How can the optical lever be placed properly on the flat?
**Answer:**
To ensure stability and accurate measurement of elongation:
1.  **Front Feet:** The two front knife-edge feet must be placed securely into the **transverse groove** on the fixed platform.
2.  **Rear Foot:** The single rear pointed foot must rest on the top surface of the **moving clamp** (chuck) that holds the wire.
3.  **Clearance:** The body of the optical lever must **not touch** the steel wire or the edges of the hole in the platform. It should be free to tilt solely due to the wire's movement.
4.  **Verticality:** The mirror should be adjusted to be roughly vertical to ensure the reflected line of sight intercepts the telescope.

### Q3.3 Troubleshooting the Telescope Image
**Question:** Analyze the possible reasons why the meter stick cannot be observed in the telescope.
**Answer:**
If the field of view is empty or dark, the potential reasons are:
1.  **Horizontal Misalignment:** The telescope axis is not pointing towards the center of the plane mirror. Use the "gun sight" (aiming aid) on top of the barrel for rough alignment.
2.  **Vertical Height Mismatch:** The telescope is positioned too high or too low relative to the optical lever, causing the line of sight to pass above or below the mirror.
3.  **Mirror Inclination:** The plane mirror is tilted too far up (reflecting the ceiling) or down (reflecting the floor). This angle depends on the relative length of the optical lever's feet and the adjustment screw.
4.  **Focusing Issue:** The telescope is not properly focused. The observer might be focused on the mirror surface itself (seeing dust) rather than the **reflected image** of the scale, which is optically much further away ($D + \text{telescope length}$).
5.  **Obstruction:** Physical objects (like the wire stand or other equipment) might be blocking the path between the scale, the mirror, and the objective lens.


### Q3.1 Reading & Instrument Error

**Answer:**
* **Reading Analysis:**
    * **Main Scale (Fixed Sleeve):** The **3 mm** integer mark is visible on the lower scale. Crucially, the **3.5 mm** half-mark on the upper scale is also visible. The 4 mm mark is hidden by the thimble.
    * **Rotating Scale (Thimble):** The datum line aligns approximately with **38.5** (between 38 and 39). This adds $0.385 \text{ mm}$.
    * **Total Reading:** $3.5 \text{ mm} + 0.385 \text{ mm} = \mathbf{3.885 \text{ mm}}$.
* **Instrument Error:**
    * The standard instrument error limit ($\Delta_{inst}$) for a laboratory micrometer gauge (0.01 mm division) is typically **0.005 mm**.

## 1. Abstract
*(Matched with Linear Fit: 2.03e11 Pa)*

This experiment aims to measure the Young's Modulus of a steel wire using the method of elongation. The microscopic elongation of the wire under tensile stress was magnified and measured using an **optical lever** combined with a telescope and scale system. The geometric parameters of the system were measured: the original length of the wire $L = 644.0 \text{ mm}$, the diameter $d = 0.578 \text{ mm}$, the mirror-to-scale distance $D = 1532.0 \text{ mm}$, and the optical lever arm $b = 68.88 \text{ mm}$. By plotting the **Stress vs. Strain curve** based on the experimental data (loads from 2.00 kg to 10.00 kg), the Young's Modulus was determined from the slope of the linear fit to be approximately **$2.03 \times 10^{11} \text{ Pa}$**. The results demonstrate a strong linear relationship, verifying Hooke's Law within the elastic limit of the material.

## 2. Conclusion
*(Summary of findings and analysis)*

In this experiment, we successfully determined the elastic modulus of the steel specimen.
1.  Experimental Finding: The Young's Modulus was calculated to be **$2.07 \times 10^{11} \text{ Pa}$** through linear regression of the Stress-Strain data. This value is in excellent agreement with the standard theoretical value for steel (approx. $2.0 \times 10^{11} \text{ Pa}$).
2.  Linearity: The data points on the graph closely follow the fitted line, confirming that the deformation was purely elastic and proportional to the applied force.
3.  Error Analysis:
 Systematic Error: The systematic error in the micrometer reading (zero error) was corrected. The diameter $d$ is the most critical measurement as its uncertainty is squared.
 Random Error: Fluctuations in estimating the tenth of a millimeter on the telescope scale and slight vibrations contributed to random errors.

## 3. Answers to Post-lab Questions
*(Strictly based on "Introductory Physics Experiments for Undergraduates" PDF)*

### Q3.1 Reading & Instrument Error (4 points)
**Question:** What is the reading shown in Fig. 1? What is the instrument error of the micrometer gauge?
**Answer:**
Reading:
Main Scale: The **3.5 mm** mark (half-millimeter division) is visible on the upper sleeve, while the 4 mm mark is hidden.
 Thimble Scale: The datum line aligns with the **38.5** division (estimated between 38 and 39). This represents $0.385 \text{ mm}$.
Total: $3.5 \text{ mm} + 0.385 \text{ mm} = \mathbf{3.885 \text{ mm}}$.
*Instrument Error:
According to the lab manual rules for the micrometer (0.01 mm division), the instrument error ($\Delta_{ins}$) is typically **0.004 mm** or **0.005 mm**.

### Q3.2 Proper Placement of Optical Lever

**Answer:**
According to the experimental procedure :
1.  Front Toes: The two front metal toes must be placed into one of the transverse grooves on the flat platform.
2.  Back Toe: The back metal toe must be placed on the surface of the clamp holding the wire.
3.  Precautions: Care must be taken to ensure the optical lever does not touch the wire, and the back toe must not be put into the cracks between the clamp and the flat.

### Q3.3 Reasons for Not Observing the Meter Stick 

**Answer:**
Based on the adjustment steps in the manual, the possible reasons are:
1.  Horizontal Misalignment: The telescope is not pointing at the plane mirror. The gap  and post on the telescope must be aligned with the mirror in one line.
2.  Vertical Height Issue: The height of the telescope is not adjusted to the same height as the optical lever.
3.  Mirror Tilt (Vertical Angle): The plane mirror is tilted too high or too low. The screw bolt in front of the plane mirror needs to be adjusted to alter the tilting.
4.  Focus/Image Distance: The image is blurry or invisible because the bolt on the right side of the telescope has not been adjusted to set the correct image distance for the scale.
5.  Telescope Tilt: The telescope itself may need adjustment. The manual notes that if the image is not seen or is blurry, one can adjust the screw under the telescope.
### Q3.1 Reading & Instrument Error 

**Answer:**

Reading:
Main Scale: The 3.5 mm mark is visible on the upper sleeve, while the 4 mm mark is hidden.
Thimble Scale: The datum line aligns with the 38.5 division. This represents $0.385 \text{ mm}$.
Total: $3.5 \text{ mm} + 0.385 \text{ mm} = \mathbf{3.885 \text{ mm}}$.

*Instrument Error:
According to the lab manual rules for the micrometer (0.01 mm division), the instrument error ($\Delta_{ins}$) is typically 0.005 mm**.
