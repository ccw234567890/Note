Awesome—here’s a tight **English speaker script** for the third presenter, matching your two images:

# Slide: **Image 5 — Field lines & Equipotentials** (~60–70s)

**[Point near the sharp tip / dense lines]**  
“On this figure you see **electric field lines** (arrows) and **equipotential lines** (smooth curves). They are **orthogonal everywhere**. Notice how lines are densest near the sharp tip—this means the **electric field is strongest** there.”

**[Trace from tip toward the plate]**  
“In an ESP we apply a **high-voltage DC** to a discharge wire or needle. When the local field exceeds a threshold, the air is **ionized** and we get **corona discharge**. Ions stream along these field lines and **charge the dust particles** in the flue gas.”

**[Hand motion sideways toward the collecting plate]**  
“Once charged, a particle experiences a force **F = qE**, so it **drifts sideways** to the collecting plate. You can think of equipotentials as ‘steps’; particles slide across the steps following the field lines until they reach the plate.”

**[Point to strong-field vs more uniform region]**  
“For **coarse particles**, **field charging** dominates in the strong-field region; for **fine particles**, **diffusion charging** also helps. The key is a field that is **strong but below breakdown**—enough to ionize, not enough to spark.”

**[Transition]**  
“So, **how strong is ‘strong but safe’?** The next slide shows the **I–V curve** that defines the operating window.”

# Slide: **Image 6 — Point-to-Plane I–V / Corona Regions** (~60–70s)

**[Glide along axes]**  
“This graph plots **current vs. voltage** for a point-to-plane geometry. It separates **onset**, **stable corona**, and **breakdown**.”

**[Tap each region as you speak]**

- “At the **onset voltage (V_0)**, sustained corona starts.”
    
- “In the **corona region**, raising voltage increases ion production, so the current **rises smoothly**. This is the **ideal ESP operating window**—we get strong **ion wind** and high **particle charging** without arcing.”
    
- “Beyond that, we hit **spark/arc breakdown**: current spikes, discharge becomes unstable, it can damage the plates, and efficiency drops. Controllers therefore **pull the voltage back** into the corona region.”
    

**[Connect to efficiency]**  
“In the corona window, particles get more charge (q) and the field (E) is stronger, so the **migration velocity (w)** increases. Collection efficiency follows the classic trend  
[  
\eta \approx 1 - e^{-\frac{A,w}{Q}},  
]  
so a higher (w) yields a much higher (\eta). But once breakdown starts, performance deteriorates.”

**[Close]**  
“**Takeaway**: ESPs work by maintaining a **controlled corona**—**strong field, no breakdown**—to charge particles quickly and drive them to the plates.”

**[Handoff]**  
“I’ll pass to Speaker 4 to show the environmental impact and cost trade-offs.”

## Ultra-short backup (≈60s total)

“Image 5 shows **field lines** and **equipotentials**—densest near the tip, so the field is strongest. A high-voltage DC creates **corona**, ions **charge particles**, and charged particles drift by **(F=qE)** to the plate.  
Image 6 shows the **I–V curve**: operate in the **corona region**—after onset, before breakdown. There, ion production and **migration velocity (w)** rise, so **(\eta \approx 1-e^{-Aw/Q})** increases. If we enter **breakdown**, efficiency and stability worsen.  
Bottom line: **strong but not breakdown**—that’s the ESP sweet spot.”
