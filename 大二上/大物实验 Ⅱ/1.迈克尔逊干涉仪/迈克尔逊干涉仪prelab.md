## (1) Derivation of Path Length Difference

**Question:** Show that the path length difference between paths ABE and ACD is given by $2d\cos\theta$.

**Proof:**
Based on the geometry in Fig. P3.8-1, we can analyze the path difference between a ray traveling to mirror $M_1$ and a ray traveling to mirror $M_2$. The mirrors are separated by a distance $d$. The beam diverges from point A at an angle $\theta$ relative to the horizontal axis.

1.  Consider the extra distance the ray traveling to mirror $M_1$ (at C) must cover compared to the ray traveling to mirror $M_2$ (at B) before reflection. By dropping a perpendicular from B to the line segment AC, we can form a right-angled triangle. The extra path length is $d\cos\theta$.
2.  After reflection from the mirrors, the rays (CD and BE) travel towards the screen. Similarly, the path length of the ray from C is longer than the path from B. By dropping a perpendicular from B to the line segment CD, we find this extra path length is also $d\cos\theta$.
3.  The total path length difference is the sum of the differences before and after reflection.

$$ \Delta L = d\cos\theta + d\cos\theta = 2d\cos\theta $$

This relationship is the condition for interference, where constructive interference occurs when the path difference is an integer multiple of the wavelength ($2d\cos\theta = m\lambda$).

## (2) Questions Regarding Figure 3.8-2

**a. How many times does the reflected beam pass through the beam splitter?**

The "reflected beam" is the light that travels towards the movable mirror $M_1$. This beam reflects off $M_1$ and travels back towards the beam splitter ($G_1$). It then **passes through** the beam splitter one time to reach the screen.

**b. What is the purpose of the compensator plate G2?**

The purpose of the compensator plate $G_2$ is to ensure that both the reflected beam (path to $M_1$) and the transmitted beam (path to $M_2$) pass through the same total thickness of glass.

**c. What is the characteristic of G2 in thickness?**

The compensator plate $G_2$ has the same thickness as the beam splitter plate $G_1$.
