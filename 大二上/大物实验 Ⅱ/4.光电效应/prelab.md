## Answers to Questions (20 points)

### (1) What is photoelectric effect threshold frequency for a given element?

**Answer:**
The threshold frequency (also called the cutoff frequency, $f_0$) is the **minimum** frequency of incident light that is required to cause the photoelectric effect for a specific material (metal).
* If the incident light's frequency is below this threshold, no photoelectrons will be emitted, regardless of the light's intensity.
* This is because, according to Einstein's model, a single photon must have enough energy ($E=h\nu$) to overcome the work function ($w$) that binds the electron within the metal.

### (2) What is work function for a given element?

**Answer:**
The work function ($w$) is the **minimum energy** required to remove an electron from the inside of a metal to its surface.
* It represents the energy binding the electron within the metal.
* The work function is an intrinsic property of each metal; different metals have different work functions (e.g., Na is 2.46 eV, Pt is 6.35 eV).

### (3) A sodium surface is illuminated with light of wavelength 0.300 µm. The work function for sodium is 2.46 eV. Calculate,
    a. The energy of each photon in electron volts;
    b. The maximum kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons;
    c. The cutoff wavelength for sodium.

**Answer:**

**Given:**
* Wavelength $\lambda = 0.300 \mu\text{m} = 300 \text{ nm}$
* Work function for sodium $w = 2.46 \text{ eV}$
* Constants: $h$ (Planck's constant), $c$ (speed of light).
* We will use the convenient formula: $E \text{ (eV)} \approx \frac{1240 \text{ eV}\cdot\text{nm}}{\lambda \text{ (nm)}}$ (derived from $E = h\nu$ and $\nu = c/\lambda$).

**a. The energy of each photon in electron volts:**
$$
E = \frac{1240 \text{ eV}\cdot\text{nm}}{300 \text{ nm}}
$$
$$
E = 4.13 \text{ eV}
$$

**b. The maximum kinetic energy of the ejected photoelectrons:**
Using Einstein's photoelectric equation: $E_{Kmax} = h\nu - w$
$$
E_{Kmax} = E_{\text{photon}} - w
$$
$$
E_{Kmax} = 4.13 \text{ eV} - 2.46 \text{ eV}
$$
$$
E_{Kmax} = 1.67 \text{ eV}
$$

**c. The cutoff wavelength for sodium:**
The cutoff wavelength $\lambda_c$ is the wavelength at which the photon energy is exactly equal to the work function ($E_{Kmax} = 0$).
$$
E_{\text{photon}} = w
$$
$$
\frac{hc}{\lambda_c} = w
$$
$$
\lambda_c = \frac{hc}{w} \approx \frac{1240 \text{ eV}\cdot\text{nm}}{w \text{ (eV)}}
$$
$$
\lambda_c = \frac{1240 \text{ eV}\cdot\text{nm}}{2.46 \text{ eV}}
$$
$$
\lambda_c \approx 504 \text{ nm}
$$
