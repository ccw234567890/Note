Class Session 3: Lecture 1 Transcript

OK. For those of you who don’t know me, I’m Dr. Lesley Jones. Welcome to this first

lecture... lecture one... in our series of lectures for the Evaluating Approaches in Electrical

Engineering course. That’s course code UESTC10888. So, in this first lecture we’re going to

examine some of the pros and cons of LED lighting systems compared to more traditional

types of lighting such as incandescent, halogen and fluorescent lighting.

So, as you already know, the use of LED lighting is becoming more and more widespread.

One of the main reasons for this is its energy efficiency. LED bulbs are much, much more

energy efficient than incandescent bulbs, halogen bulbs and even compact fluorescent

bulbs. In fact, an LED bulb will use 75% less energy to produce exactly the same levels of

light of an equivalent halogen bulb.

OK, so, the main reason for this efficiency relates to heat. Now, I’m sure many of you have

experienced trying to change a bulb or move a lamp that’s been on for a while and then

screaming because you’ve burnt your hand, right? Yes, I thought so. Well, it hurts because

most of the electrical energy that goes into incandescent and halogen bulbs is lost as heat.

In fact, nearly 95% of the energy consumed by incandescent bulbs disappears as heat.

LED bulbs though... well, they’re different. They emit almost no heat, and in some cases no

heat at all. This means that all, or the vast majority of electrical energy they consume is

used to create the light they produce, making them very energy efficient. This in turn

means lower energy bills and, if energy is coming from fossil fuels, much lower CO2

emissions. Great, right?

Now, apart from being energy efficient, LED bulbs are also much more durable and robust

than traditional bulbs. So, what do I mean by durable and robust? Well, I mean they don’t

break as easily and they have longer lifespans. Again, I’m sure many of you have

experienced dropping a bulb on the ground accidentally and watching it break into a thousand pieces. Well, even a light impact will cause the glass in most traditional bulbs to

break. LED bulbs though.... well, they’re tough. Most LED bulbs can be dropped, bumped,

bashed, hit... and still keep functioning as normal. This makes them great for use in sports

grounds, streets, cars, etc.

Now, since I’ve mentioned cars, I should also say here that there has been a problem with

LED lights in cars. Yes, they don’t break as easily, but many drivers find them too bright.

Maybe some of you have experienced this. You’re driving at night and another car is driving

towards you. Suddenly, you can’t see properly because the lights from that car are so

bright. It’s not just annoying, it’s also extremely dangerous and causes many car accidents.

But, as I was saying, LED bulbs are less easy to break and, on top of that, have a longer

lifespan. Why is that valuable? Well, it means fewer resources are wasted making

replacement bulbs and less money is spent buying them.

Now, it’s worth noting here that older LED bulbs, the first and second generation bulbs,

well they had a problem with temperature changes. If temperatures suddenly increased or

decreased by a large amount, then the bulbs would malfunction... they’d stop working.

However, the more recent designs have overcome this, so it’s no longer a problem.

Right, so, let’s move on to our next benefit of LEDs... let me check my notes... oh, yes, their

ability to target light more accurately. So, what does that mean? Well, because an LED light

can be created in almost any shape, it means that the light can be focussed in any direction

that is required. What I mean is it’s easier to direct the light to where you want the light to

be. So, for example, for street lights, the light can be focussed on the ground without it also

going into the windows of nearby buildings or homes. This doesn’t just mean people are

less annoyed by unwanted light, but it also means that less energy is being wasted, because

you're only using exactly the amount of light you need to light up exactly what you want to

light up – no light is being wasted.

OK, now, we’re almost out of time, so I’ll just quickly talk you through some of the

drawbacks of LEDs. Now, I already mentioned that the older generation bulbs couldn’t

handle temperature changes, yes? Yes. And I explained about the danger LED bulbs which

are too bright can cause for drivers. Now, believe it or not there is evidence that LED bulbs

might be causing damage to the environment. Why is that? Well, the problem is that many

businesses.... eh, organisations... you know, they’ve been rushing to change to LED bulbs.

That change should be good, shouldn’t it? Well, yes and no.

Unfortunately, in many cases, those businesses and... eh... organisations etc are throwing

away all their incandescent and fluorescent bulbs. Now, that might save energy on lighting

bills, but when those bulbs are thrown away before the end of their lifespans... you know...

when they’re still functional... well, that means the energy and materials that went into

their manufacture is being wasted... all the glass... metals... and so on, is just going to

waste. This is quite a serious problem.

Thankfully, though, many governments have now invested in increasing the number of bulb

recycling plants in their countries. That means the bulbs can be broken down into their

individual components, so the glass, the tungsten filaments,... er... the steel support wires...

etc, can be collected and then re-used to manufacture other products.

OK, right, to sum up: LED lights are now the dominant type of lighting system used in many

countries and this is very unlikely to change any time soon. This isn’t only due to their

energy efficiency, but also their durability, their flexibility, and all the benefits those

characteristics bring.

OK, if you’ve missed anything or are unsure of anything, remember copies of the

PowerPoint slides for this lecture will be available on Moodle at the end of the week. I’ll see

you all at the next lecture!
